The Ethiopian wolf is the most endangered candid.

The Ethiopian wolf used to live in many parts of Africa mainly Ethiopia where they got their name. These wolves look like jackals, they have a long, pointy snout.  They have long long legs with a regular sized body.  Their fur darkens as they grow it is very, very rare but is sometimes white, usually it is reddish or brown.

They hunt on their own even though they live in packs they eat rodents.  They choose rodents because they are easier to hunt alone.

These wolves are still territorial but not quite as aggressive as other wolves.

Theyâ€™re endangered because hunting by humans for food.  And loss of habitat, and hybridization (mating with another animal and making hybrids), with domestic dogs. Another is lack of divergence of genes they breed with their family.

Main problems are diseases since Ethiopian wolves are candid's they can get pathogens from dogs.  So they have sadly gotten rabies which kill many of them along with some others like Africian wild dogs and some other foxes.

This species has many threats. You can help them at <http://ethiopianwolf.org/donate>.
