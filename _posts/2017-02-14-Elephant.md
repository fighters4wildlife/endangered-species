There are many different Elephants: African, Asian, Indian, Sumatran, Borneo, and Sri Lankan.  They are 5-14 ft (males) and females are smaller in size. For length it can be up to 30 feet, tail to trunk.  Their lifespan can be up to 70 years and weight can be 6,000 -15,000 lbs.

They eat crops like sugarcane and banana. But mostly bamboo, leaves, bark and roots.  Elephant adults eat from 300-400 lbs each day!

African elephants live in savannahs.  And the Asian in most of the Southeast parts of Asia.  Elephants are close with the family (herd) and have long memory and are very emotionally.

They are endangered because of hunting to get Ivory which their tusks are made of.  And because of habitat loss, and heat.  The babies get stuck in mud pits too.
