Polar bearsb live in the arctic. It can reguarly be below 30 degrees. Protect them from the cold, they have an outer layer of fur with an undercoat and a thick layer of fat for warmth.

  Polar bears fur looks white, but is actually transparent or see through. The fur is hollow, when the sun reflects on it it looks white. Underneath the fur, polar bears have black skin!
  
  That sucks in the warmth of the sun. Polar bears normally eat seal. They wait for them at breathing holes.
  
  They also can eat walrus, which can be dangerous because of sharp tusks. They also eat whale, small rodents, fish, eggs, sea birds, and berries. Hunting takes up 50% of a polar bear's life!
  
  Polar bears are endangered because of global warming, which melts their ice and habitat. Another is oil spills which poison their prey and makes them sick. You can help Polar bears at <PolarBearsinternational.org>
