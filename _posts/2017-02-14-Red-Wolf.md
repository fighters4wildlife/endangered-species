Red wolves are smaller, thinner wolves then the grey wolf.  Wolves are a grayish black with a reddish tint which gives the name red wolf.

The red wolfâ€™s prey is small mammals, like rodents and rabbits.  They also eat insects, deer and some berries.

Red wolves communicate by body movements, scent markings, facial expressions and sounds (like howling).  

Red wolves hunt either by their selves or small packs.  

Their dens are usually in hollow trees, and sometimes stream banks.

The red wolves mating season is in late winter and have 2 to 8 pups!

The red wolves are very endangered because of loss of habitat and illegal killings.  Red wolves hunt farmers' animals and farmers shoot them. 

They make hybrids with coyotes.

To help save the red wolves donate to them at <http://nywolf.org/>.

It is a wolf conservation center where you can donate to red wolves.
