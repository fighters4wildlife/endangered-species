<h4>This project is a collaborative effort of 5th grade students @ <a href="http://www.amphi.com/CopperCreek">Cooper Creek Elementary</a> school as part of the <a href="http://www.geniushour.com/">Genius Hour</a>.</h4>
<br>
<h4>It is a place where you can quickly learn about most endangered animals and access resources for contributing to their cause.</h4>
<br> 
<h4>By simplifying access to the list of these animals we are hoping to make a difference.</h4>
